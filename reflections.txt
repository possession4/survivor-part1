How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent quite a long time on this project because I needed to take some time out for personal reasons. Probably around a month and a half on and off.


What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding personal challenge was powering through the feeling of being lost after taking a break. Some things came back to me fairly quickly and other things that I didn't remember made me increasingly frustrated.


Where do you still have room to grow?
Because I've taken a few sabbaticals from the code and it's been hard for me to jump back in. I need to work on being consistent with my learning so this doesn't happen in the future.
